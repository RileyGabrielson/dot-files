# dot-files
a humble dev configuration

Using GNU Stow to add references to these dotfiles in system directories.

TODO:
 - Get prettier formatting!
 - change bindings for exiting terminal
 - get linter set up
 - switch to telescope
 - use telescope for find and replace
 - investigate faster typescript lsp
   - neoclide/coc.nvim looks promising
   - make sure can disable relative imports
 - I want to enter command mode when changing a symbol name
