a humble dev configuration

Using GNU Stow to add references to these dotfiles in system directories.

TODO:
 - Use the input mapping solution Colton mentioned
 - Get prettier formatting!
 - configure signature better, it was getting pretty annoying
 - change bindings for exiting terminal
 - get linter set up
 - switch to telescope
 - use telescope for find and replace
 - investigate faster typescript lsp
 - get cmp setup, possibly with a new snippet language
   - show path next to the import
   - disable relative imports (tsserver?)
   - fancy it up yo
 - I want to enter command mode when changing a symbol name
